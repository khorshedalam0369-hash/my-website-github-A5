Below are the answers to five questions.


1️⃣ What is the difference between var, let, and const?
Below is the difference between var, let and const
1.Scope
var function scoped: If it is declared in a function, it is available inside the function, not outside it And if it is declared outside the function, it is available in the any block levels because it is ignore block levels
const and let are block scoped: It exists within curly braces and is safe for loops and conditionals.
2.Hosting
JavaScript hosting has a default behavior for passing variables declared in the exist scope.
var: It is hoisted and initialized as undefined. You can access it before its line of code without a crash, but it will just return undefined
let & const: They are also hoisted but not initialized. If you try to access them before the declaration line, you get a ReferenceError. This gap is called the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ).
3.Reassignment vs. Immutability
If you declare a variable with var , you can reassert that value in the variable.and declared same names variable.
If you declare a variable with let , you can reassert that value in the variable.
If you declare a variable with const, you cannot reassign that value to the variable. But if the value is an object or array, you can change the property on the object or array.


2️⃣ What is the spread operator (...)?
Spread operator is a powerful syntax that includes Es6 It is used to spread (unpack) properties of objects or arrays.


3️⃣ What is the difference between map(), filter(), and forEach()?
think of it this way: forEach() is a worker, map() is a transformer, and filter() is a bouncer.
1. forEach() -> the worker.
use this when you want to do something with every item but don't need a new array back.
2. map() -> the transformer.
Use this when you want to change every item in an array and keep this results in a brand-new array of the same length.
3. filter() -> the bouncer.
Use this when you want to select certain items based on a condition.


4️⃣ What is an arrow function?
An arrow function is a shorter and modern way to write function in javasCript using => the symbol..
it is removes the need for function keyword.
it does not have this context, which makes it very useful inside classes or callback.
if hte function has only one line , you don't even need to write return.


5️⃣ What are template literals?
Template literals
are modern way to handle string in javascript. The make it much easier ro combine text and variables together.
